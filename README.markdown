# About #

Mainboard is an S3 REST service clone, using MongoDB/GridFS as data storage.

It's based on the Padrino Framework (which in turn is based on Sinatra) and requires 
ruby 1.9. It has been heavily influenced by \_why's Park Place, and Boardwalk.

Mainboard is a rack 1.3 compliant application, but so far only supports asynchronous
servers (ie: thin). It has provisions for running in Cloudforge VCAP, taking
autoconfiguration from the environment.
